Day 2 task:

Difference between document and windows object

Window Objects:
The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name,browser history, location and the deviceâ€™s screen etc. 

It is the top most object and outermost element of the object hierarchy.

Document Object:
The document object is html, aspx, php other document that will be loaded into the browser.Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object.
The document object represents the whole html document as a tree of Objects(HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other HTML tags). 

It is the root element that represents the html document. The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc. That means if you want to access a property for the window it is window.property, if it is document it is window.document.property which is also available in short as document.property.

Iframe:
An iframe actually is considered as a new window with its own document loaded into it. The original parent window is responsible for other windows to be loaded not the document.
The property to access a frame is window.frames[], which is an array of all the frames. If you only have one iframe you access it by using window.frames[0]. Since the iframe is also a window object, accessing window properties of that frame is done by using window.frames[0].mywindowproperty.
